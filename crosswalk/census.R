#' ### Creating a block-group-to-block-group crosswalk
#'
#' To interpolate many block-group statistics (e.g. Asian population, White population, Black population), we first make a block-group-to-block-group crosswalk.
#'
#' First, retrieve block-level population data in Brooklyn in 2010.

blk_pop_2010 <- get_decennial(
  geography = "block",
  state = "New York",
  county = "Kings",
  variables = "P001001",
  year = 2010
) %>%
  select(GEOID, pop = value)

#' Read in the NHGIS 2010 block to 2020 block crosswalk.

blk_crosswalk <-
  read.csv("./nhgis_blk2010_blk2020_ge_36047.csv") %>%
  mutate(GEOID10 = as.character(GEOID10), GEOID20 = as.character(GEOID20)) %>%
  select(GEOID10, GEOID20, WEIGHT, PAREA)

#' Interpolate the 2010 block-level population data from 2010 blocks to 2020 blocks.

blk2020_pop_2010 <- blk_crosswalk %>%
  inner_join(blk_pop_2010 %>% rename(GEOID10 = GEOID), by = "GEOID10") %>%

#' Find the proportion of the 2010 block groupâ€™s population that lies in each 2020 block group.

bg_crosswalk <- blk2020_pop_2010 %>%

#' ### Using the block-group-to-block-group crosswalk
#'
#' Retrieve 2010 block-group-level population data that we want to interpolate into 2020 block groups. Below, I'm grabbinng the Asian population and the total population for each block group.

#' We have interpolated 2010's population data to 2020 block groups. Now, download 2020 block-group-level population data so we can look at both years together.
