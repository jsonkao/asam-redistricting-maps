## Introduction

This repository introduces a tool and a workflow for reporting on urban heat and urban heat inequity. The tool visualizes temperatures sourced from satellite imagery. It juxtaposes the temperatures with infrastructural, environmental, and demographic variables that are relevant to reporting on and understanding urban heat.

## Use case: Port Morris

An example use case of this workflow might be as follows.

On the tool, you can just view temperature in a certain year. (Yellow signifies hotter, and blue signifies colder.) In the view above, near the "PORT MORRIS" label, you can see an area of dark yellow stretching upwards. If you toggle on the impervious surfacing layer...

... you see that the entire stretch has a high amount of impervious surfacing.

An example of using the visualization to find a story is in the south Bronx. I had the impervious surfacing metric toggled on, in combination with the temperature map. was curious about what a strip

Multiple interstate highways, power plants, and trucking operations are there.

	// writeup with images: what u did, why, the workflow, how it could be useful to journalists, and next steps. doesn't have to be long â€” get to the damn point. bullet points and images.  at least a draft of that stuff
